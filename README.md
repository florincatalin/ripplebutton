# ripplebutton
customised ripple button using div

Often we want a button that will attract the attention of the visitor.

The source of inspiration is

Only the html button does not support < div > structures, but only < span >.

One possibility would be to use < div > as a button.

In order to interact with the user the button must be equipped with javascript. In this case, just click. If you want you can add other interaction modes by editing the ripplebutton.js file in the js folder. E.g: onclick="javascript:this.form.submit();
